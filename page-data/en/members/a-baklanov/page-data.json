Our method is based on analysis of the kinetic\nenergy of all three photofragments, where the O atom kinetic energy was directly measured in the experiment\nand the kinetic energy of the X partner was calculated using momentum conservation, along with\nthe measured angular anisotropy for O atom recoil. We exploit the fact that the clusters are all T-shaped or\nnearly T-shaped, which we also confirm by ab initio calculations, along with knowledge of the transition dipole\ngoverning radiative absorption by the complex.
