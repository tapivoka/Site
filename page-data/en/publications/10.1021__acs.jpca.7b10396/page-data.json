Using the MS-TOF technique,\natomic titanium and titanium(II) oxide (TiO) were detected among the most abundant photofragments.\nExperimental results were rationalized with the aid of quantum chemical calculations (DLPNO–CCSD(T) and DFT).\nContrary to the existing data in the literature, the new four-centered acetone-elimination reaction was found to be\nthe primary decomposition process of TTIP. According to computational results, the effective activation barrier\nof this channel was ∼49 kcal/mol, which was ∼13 kcal/mol lower than that of the competing propylene elimination.\nThe former process, followed by the dissociative loss of an H atom, was a dominating channel of\nTTIP unimolecular decay. The sequential loss of isopropoxy moieties via these two-step processes was supposed\nto produce the experimentally observed titanium atoms. In turn, the combination of these reactions with propylene\nelimination can lead to another detected species, TiO. These results indicate that the existing mechanisms of\nTTIP thermal and photoinitiated decomposition in the chemical-vapor deposition (CVD) of titanium dioxide should\nbe reconsidered.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Decomposition Pathways of Titanium Isopropoxide Ti(O<sup>i</sup>Pr)<sub>4</sub>: New Insights from UV-Photodissociation Experiments and Quantum Chemical Calculations","journal":"The Journal of Physical Chemistry A","year":"2018","volume":"122","issue":null,"author":"Ershov, Kirill and Kochubei, S. and Kiselev, Vitaly and Baklanov, Alexey","doi":"10.1021/acs.jpca.7b10396"},"fields":{"slug":"/publications/10.1021__acs.jpca.7b10396","locale":"ru"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"name":"10.1021__acs.jpca.7b10396","type":"publications","slug":"/publications/10.1021__acs.jpca.7b10396","locale":"en"}}}
