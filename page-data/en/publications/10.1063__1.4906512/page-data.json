In the gas phase, the transient Li<sup>+</sup> and LiI<sup>+</sup> ion signals feature\ndamped oscillations due to the excitation and decay of a vibrational wave packet. Based on high-level <i>ab initio</i>\ncalculations of the electronic structure of LiI and simulations of the wave packet dynamics,\nthe exponential signal decay is found to result from predissociation predominantly at the lowest\navoided X-A potential curve crossing, for which we infer a coupling constant V<sub>XA</sub> = 650(20) cm−1. The\nlack of a pump-probe delay dependence for the case of LiI embedded in helium nanodroplets indicates fast\ndroplet-induced relaxation of the vibrational excitation.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Predissociation dynamics of lithium iodide","journal":"The Journal of Chemical Physics","year":"2015","volume":"142","issue":null,"author":"Schmidt, H. and von Vangerow, J. and Stienkemeier, F. and Bogomolov, A.
