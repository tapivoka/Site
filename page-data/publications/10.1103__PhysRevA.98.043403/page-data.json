The good agreement of the measured time-dependent\nvelocity distributions with the simulation when exciting the Rb dopant atoms into the 6p\nstate supports the pseudodiatomic model for the Rb-He droplet interaction, even on the level of\nquantum wave-packet dynamics. Time-resolved photoelectron spectra reveal the partitioning of excitation\nenergy into the dopant and the droplet degrees of freedom.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Quantum dynamics of Rb atoms desorbing off the surface of He nanodroplets","journal":"Physical Review A","author":"Dozmorov, N.
