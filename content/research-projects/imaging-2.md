The velocity map imaging (VMI) method allows us to take a picture of the velocities, i.e. speed and direction, 
of the products of dynamical processes such as photodissociation and bimolecular collisions. 
VMI is an adaptation of time of flight mass spectrometry (ToFMS), and as such also has the ability to separate, 
and selectively detect, ions by mass. In our experiments such ions have usually been formed by the quantum state 
selective Resonance Enhanced Multi Photon Ionisation (REMPI) method. We use REMPI-VMI as 
a detection technique in a wide variety of our experimental projects to give us a simultaneous measurement of 
the internal energy & velocity of reaction products.
