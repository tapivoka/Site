An automated apparatus is presented that allows a user to measure the mass spectrum 
or velocity map images of photofragments during tuning of the dye-laser radiation wavelength and 
its second harmonic, which interact with an investigated substance in a molecular beam. 
The NI LabVIEW environment was used for automation. The apparatus was successfully tested when studying 
the resonant ionization of oxygen molecules. The automation software makes it possible to extend 
the possibilities of measuring spectral dependences by creating additional modules without 
modifying the existing program code.
